# Battleships

![Battleships Main Menu Image](/images/main_menu_img.png)

Battleships is designed to be a fun guessing game that the user can play against the computer.
The Game is designed with a 5x5 grid where the player can choose the location of their ships and make their own guesses.
While CPU ships and guesses will be uniquely generated by the program.

## User experience (UX)

### Project Goals

- Provide a fun guessing style game for a user to play against the computer.

- The game must feel fair to play.

- The game should provide clear instruction on how to play.

- There must be no game crashing bugs. the program should handle all invalid inputs appropriately.

- The game should repeat when finished.

### User Stories

- As a user, I would like clear instruction on how to play the game.

- As a user, i would like the game to be smooth and user friendly.

- As a user, I would like to feel like i am playing a fair game.

- As a user, I would like to be able to place my ships myself and make my own guesses.

- As a user, I would like the game to not crash if I create an invalid input.

- As a user, I would like the game to loop back around to the beginning when it is over.

### Data Model

The initial data that is taken and processed is the players ship locations. Before they are taken from the user, the player grid is created
as a place to store the ships. Then co-ordinates are taken from the player as an input, and converted into a cell on the grid.

Before a ship is placed, the co-ordinates are validated and checked if they are unique. If they pass these tests, an 'S' symbol is placed 
on its co-ordinate on the grid. This is repeated until the player has 3 ships placed. 

After this, three unique co-ordintes are generated from a function beofre being validated. If they pass, the 'S' symbols are stored on the 'CPU board'
however this board is not printed to the user, it is only used for checking for player hits later on. 
Instead an empty "Shot board" is printed. This will store the 'hit' or 'miss' markers for the player too see.

Then player input will be taken in co-ordinate form for the player guesses. These co-ordinates are validated to be on the board, then a function checks if the
cell has already been chosen. If the tests are passes. The correct marker will be printed to the board.

Finally, A CPU guess is randomly generated, validated, then added to a 'set' before being logged to the board. This is so each new
CPU guess can be checked for 'uniqueness' as the game goes on. preventing to CPU guessing the same places more than once.

### Flowchart

The Flowchart below was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) to help plan the data-flow of this project.

## Features

### ASCII Art

ASCII art is used throughout the project for Titles and lables for grids.

I have chosen to use ASCII art as it adds visual appeal to the game.

All ASCII art was generated using [ascii.co.uk](https://ascii.co.uk/)

![CPU ascii label](/images/cpu_ascii_label.png)

### Main Menu

Give the user a choice between reading the rules, or starting the game.

Allows people who already know the rules to have the choice to not see them again.

![Battleships Main Menu Image](/images/main_menu_img.png)

### Rules

Displays the rules for the user.

![Battleships rules image](/images/battleship_rules_img.png)

### Player Ship Selection

Takes users input as co-ordinates in order to place their ships.
This allows the user to choose where their ships are placed on the grid

![Player ship placement image](/images/player_ship_placement.png)

### Player Ship Validation

Checks if the player co-ordinates given is a valid co-ordinate on the grid and handles invalid inputs.

![Player ship placement validation image](/images/player_placement_validation.png)

### Random CPU Ship Generator

Generates three unique co-ordinates at random to be used for the CPU ships.

### CPU Ship Validation

Checks if the CPU co-ordinate given is a valid co-ordinate on the grid and handles invalid inputs.

### Processing Players Guesses

This allows the user to take guesses at the CPU ships locations. 
It takes players input co-ordinates and returns them to the program.

![Player guess image](/images/player_guess_img.png)

### Player Guess Validation

Checks if the player co-ordinate given is a valid co-ordinate on the grid and handles invalid inputs.

![Input Validation Image](/images/invalid_letter_img.png)

### Generate Unique CPU Guesses

Generates random unique co-ordinates, stores them in a set, then returns them to the program.
Then in future moves, the set set is used to check if the new co-ordinate is unique

![CPU guesses player ship location image](/images/cpu_guess_img.png)

### CPU Guess Validation

Checks if the CPU co-ordinate given is a valid co-ordinate on the grid and handles invalid inputs.

### Game Reset

This causes the game to reset when it is finished, allowing the player to play again without restarting the program.

![Game reset image](/images/restart_game_img.png)

### Ship counter

Keeps track of the amount of ships left for the Player and the CPU.

## Technologies Used

### Languague Used

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used

-[Virtual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used for writing my code, committing, and then pushing to github.

-[GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store my project after pushing.

-[Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) was used to deploy the application.

-[CI Python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate the python code.

-[ASCII.co.uk](https://ascii.co.uk/) was used to create the ASCII art used in the application.

-[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) was used to create the flowchart.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

* As a user, I would like clear instruction on how to play the game.

    - A rules option is given in the main menu.
    - The rules provide clear instruction about how to play the game.
    - The user is reminded of the correct inputs if the provide an incorrect input.

* As a user, i would like the game to be smooth and user friendly.

    - The runs without crashes.

* As a user, I would like to feel like i am playing a fair game.
    
    - The CPU inputs are generated randomly.
    - The CPU does not read user inputs for an advantage.

* As a user, I would like to be able to place my ships myself and make my own guesses.

    - The program allows the user to input their own ship locations

* As a user, I would like the game to not crash if I create an invalid input.

    - The program handles all invalid inputs without crasdhing the game.

* As a user, I would like the game to loop back around to the beginning when it is over.

    - The program has a reset function that resets back to the main menu after 5 seconds.
    - This is triggered when the game is over.

### Code Validation

- The [CI Python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used to validate The code in this project.
