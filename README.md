# Battleships

![Battleships Main Menu Image](/images/main_menu_img.png)

Battleships is designed to be a fun guessing game that the user can play against the computer.
The Game is designed with a 5x5 grid where the player can choose the location of their ships and make their own guesses.
While CPU ships and guesses will be uniquely generated by the program.

## User experience (UX)

### Project Goals

- Provide a fun guessing style game for a user to play against the computer.

- The game must feel fair to play.

- The game should provide clear instruction on how to play.

- There must be no game crashing bugs. the program should handle all invalid inputs appropriately.

- The game should repeat when finished.

### User Stories

- As a user, I would like clear instruction on how to play the game.

- As a user, i would like the game to be smooth and user friendly.

- As a user, I would like to feel like i am playing a fair game.

- As a user, I would like to be able to place my ships myself and make my own guesses.

- As a user, I would like the game to not crash if I create an invalid input.

- As a user, I would like the game to loop back around to the beginning when it is over.

### Data Model

The initial data that is taken and processed is the players ship locations. Before they are taken from the user, the player grid is created
as a place to store the ships. Then co-ordinates are taken from the player as an input, and converted into a cell on the grid.

Before a ship is placed, the co-ordinates are validated and checked if they are unique. If they pass these tests, an 'S' symbol is placed 
on its co-ordinate on the grid. This is repeated until the player has 3 ships placed. 

After this, three unique co-ordintes are generated from a function beofre being validated. If they pass, the 'S' symbols are stored on the 'CPU board'
however this board is not printed to the user, it is only used for checking for player hits later on. 
Instead an empty "Shot board" is printed. This will store the 'hit' or 'miss' markers for the player too see.

Then player input will be taken in co-ordinate form for the player guesses. These co-ordinates are validated to be on the board, then a function checks if the
cell has already been chosen. If the tests are passes. The correct marker will be printed to the board.

Finally, A CPU guess is randomly generated, validated, then added to a 'set' before being logged to the board. This is so each new
CPU guess can be checked for 'uniqueness' as the game goes on. preventing to CPU guessing the same places more than once.

### Flowchart

The Flowchart below was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/) to help plan the data-flow of this project.

## Features

### ASCII Art

ASCII art is used throughout the project for Titles and lables for grids.

I have chosen to use ASCII art as it adds visual appeal to the game.

All ASCII art was generated using [ascii.co.uk](https://ascii.co.uk/)

### Main Menu

Give the user a choice between reading the rules, or starting the game.

Allows people who already know the rules to have the choice to not see them again.

### Rules

Displays the rules for the user.

### Player Ship Selection

Takes users input as co-ordinates in order to place their ships.

### Player Ship Validation

Checks if the co-ordinate given is a valid co-ordinate on the grid and handles invalid inputs
